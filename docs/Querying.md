Dyngoose has simple, yet powerful, querying support. Every query supports performing additional filters, but as DynamoDB is heavily optimized for getting items by indexes, the primary way you should perform operations is by using an index.

[Read more about managing Indexes](Indexes.md).

## Query methods

### `.search(filters)`

> https://github.com/benhutchins/dyngoose/blob/master/src/table.ts#L78

The first place to look at is the `.search` method available on every [Table](Table.md) class. The `.search` method is an all around "find me my data, now!" method. It will automatically use an index when available, but does not force the use of indexes and will fallback to a filtered [scan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Scan.html) operation if necessary.

`.search` accepts a `filters: DynamoDB.Filters` argument, which is dynamically typed based on your table's properties. This means it will only allow you to pass in properties that are defined the table subclass and will enforce type consistency for all values.

Each individual filter can specify additional conditions. See [Filter Conditions](#filter-conditions) below to see all possible conditions.

```typescript
// a simple search
User.search({ email: 'john@example.com' })

// perform a search for any email containing @example.com
User.search({ email: ['contains', '@example.com'] })
```

### `.primaryKey.get(hash, range)`

Get a record by it's primary key values. This returns the record instance directly or will return `void` if the record could not be found.

You can also use `.get(hash, range)` which will use the `Dyngoose.Query.PrimaryKey` instance on the table.

### `.primaryKey.query(filters)`

Perform a filtered query on a table using the primary key. You must specify filters for your table's `HASH` and `RANGE`, but can additionally provide more filters to narrow the results.

### `.primaryKey.scan([filters])`

Perform a [scan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Scan.html) operation on the table. Can optionally specify filters to narrow the results, or leave blank to get all the records within the table.

### `.gsiIndex.query(filters)`

Perform a filtered query on a table using a GlobalSecondaryIndex. You must specify filters for your index's `HASH` and `RANGE`, but can additionally provide more filters to narrow the results.

### `.gsiIndex.scan([filters])`

Perform a [scan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Scan.html) operation on the table using a GlobalSecondaryIndex. Can optionally specify filters to narrow the results, or leave blank to get all the records within the index.

### `.lsiIndex.query(filters)`

Perform a filtered query on a table using a LocalSecondaryIndex. You must specify filters for your table's `HASH` and the index's `RANGE`, but can additionally provide more filters to narrow the results.

### `.lsiIndex.scan([filters])`

Perform a [scan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Scan.html) operation on the table using a LocalSecondaryIndex. Can optionally specify filters to narrow the results, or leave blank to get all the records within the index.

## `Dyngoose.Results`

All query methods in `Dyngoose`, other than `.primaryKey.get(â€¦)` will return an object that matches the `Dyngoose.Results` interface. 

See the [`src/query/results.ts`](https://github.com/benhutchins/dyngoose/blob/master/src/query/results.ts).

## Filter Conditions

The available conditions for `Dyngoose.Filters` are:

| Condition | Example | Purpose |
|-|-|-|
| `=` | `{ email: 'john@example.com' }` or `{ email: ['=', 'john@example.com'] }` | Attribute value must exactly match the specified value. |
| `<>` | `{ email: ['<>', 'john@example.com' }` | Attribute value must not match specified value. |
| `<` | `{ count: ['<', 100] }` | Attribute must be less than specified value. Works on `Number`, `String`, and `Date` attribute types. |
| `<=` | `{ count: ['<=', 99] }` | Attribute must be less than or equal to specified value. Works on `Number`, `String`, and `Date` attribute types. |
| `>` | `{ count: ['>', 100] }` | Attribute must be greater than specified value. Works on `Number`, `String`, and `Date` attribute types. |
| `>=` | `{ count: ['>=', 100] }` | Attribute must be greater than or equal to specified value. Works on `Number`, `String`, and `Date` attribute types. |
| `beginsWith` | `{ name: ['beginsWith', 'John'] }` | Attribute must start with specified value. |
| `between` | `{ dateOfBirth: ['between', Date.parse('1990-01-01'), Date.parse('1999-12-31')] }` | Looks for any record where the attribute value is between the given range. Works on `Number`, `String`, and `Date` attribute types. |
| `includes` | `{ numbers: ['includes', [1, 2, 3]] }` | Looks within a [Set Attribute](Attributes.md#set-attributes) for any of the specified values. Values must match exactly. |
| `excludes` | `{ skills: ['excludes', ['magic', 'sorcery']] }` | Looks within a [Set Attribute](Attributes.md#set-attributes) to verify no value matches the specified values. Values must match exactly. |
| `contains` | `{ email: ['contains', '@example.com'] }` | Looks at a value to see if it contains the given substring. This can be performed on a [Set Attribute](Attributes.md#set-attributes) to look for partial matches instead of exact matches. |
| `not contains` | `{ email: ['not contains', '@example.com'] }` | Similar to `contains`, except the exact opposite. Values must not contain the given substring. |
| `null` | `{ someProperty: ['null']` | Attribute value must exist and the value must be null. |
| `not null` | `{ someProperty: ['not null'] }` | Attribute value value must exist and have any value other than null. |
| `exists` | `{ someProperty: ['exists'] }` | Attribute must exist, value can be anything, including `NULL`. |
| `not exists` | `{ someProperty: ['not exists'] }` | Attribute must not exist on the record at all. |
